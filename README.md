# Mimic.css

Mimic.css is an css animations library because everyone else is doing it.

## How To Use The Darn Thing

Simple, just add the mimic.css stylesheet to the `<head>` of your HTML document as such: 

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/mimic.css">
</head>
```
Or you can use the minified version!: 

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/mimic.min.css">
</head>
```

Next, to animate, you will need to add the class `animated` to your element, with any of the mimic.css classes.

What's it mimic?:

| Class Name | Mimics |
|-------------|-------------|
| `boomerang` | a boomerang |
| `swivelChair` | a swivel chair |
| `gettinInYoFace` | someone gettin' in yo' face |
| `airplanePropeller` | an airplane propeller |
| `pulsate` | something pulsating |
| `candleInTheWind` | a candle in the wind |
| `highlighter` | a highlighter |
| `lawnMower` | a lawn mower blade |
| `bungee` | a bungee jump |
| `nope` | a head shaking nope |
| `heartBeat` | a heartbeat |
| `sleepyEyes` | sleepy eyes |
| `plummit` | plummiting |
| `dropItLikeItsHot` | droping something like it's hot |
| `gettinLifted` | gettin' lifted |

| `chameleon` | a chameleon |
| `backdrop` | a stage backdrop |

For example:
